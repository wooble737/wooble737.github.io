      <h2>My Favorite Tracks</h2>
      <ul class="music-list">
        <li>
          <strong>underscores - Uncanny Long arms (with Jane Remover)</strong>
          <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3j38fb5Pna0iFQhtUGuT8c?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
          <p class="track-description">I never really thought I would place such a track in the first place. When I was looking through "Wallsocket" (underscore's album), I skipped the song 30 seconds in. Having said that, after a re-listen, I made it to the last few parts. I was blown away by the sheer emotion and storytelling. Maybe a bit on a personal level, but the lyrics heavily resonated with me at the time. Having dug deeper, I found out that the final verse was from the earlier album song "Kinko’s field trip 2006" staying as a leitmotif for the latter. Great song. Thank you, underscores, for your fearless and free songs</p>

          <strong>xi – Ascension to Heaven</strong>
          <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4VgQDGeib4KMN3iXr410Sr?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
          <p class="track-description">Regardless if you ever played any rhythm games or listened to xi before, his approach to creating artcore (EM genre) is the best that I have ever seen. Simpler than most, yet much more telling than any other. "Parousia", his album from which this song comes from, is one of the highest acclaimed of any other in the same playfield by critics and the common folk. For me, even though I am not religious, listening to this creates a special kind of sadness and bliss combined into one emotion. Thank you for your passion, xi</p>

          <strong>Camellia – Exit this Earth's Atmosphere</strong>
          <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0Ww4xWSspmcAO6N8zzaR3d?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
          <p class="track-description">Camellia, as opposed to the 2nd place in my favorites, explores strictly positive feelings in his EDM, frankly. I first found out about him and this song from the Geometry Dash level "Ocular Miracle" around 5 years ago. The middle part drop made it all click for me, and I have been a huge fan ever since (video showcase - https://youtu.be/rf3Zt6e-zrw?si=ehrFs72bssFoi2vk). Fun Fact: I thought that Camellia (@cametek) was a girl for a very long time before finding his images with his signature fedora on. Not that this ruins it for me - quite the opposite, actually :eyes:</p>

          <strong>Silentroom - Nhelv</strong>
          <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2gLjWQlWQm6OR5l6fHc1ZK?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
          <p class="track-description">Nhelv is wonderful. The version I linked is the full one. This is the song that made me enjoy longer and longer tracks, taking in any new details that they can produce to a seasoned mind on every new listen. The rhythm is fantastic; the imaginative journey it gives - rich and full of detail. Thank you, Silentroom</p>

          <strong>Kendrick Lamar – Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst</strong>
          <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1Z2FvDFZSDQ23s4BDqpWqZ?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameBorder="0" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
          <p class="track-description">The lyrical genius Kendrick Lamar has to offer is nothing short of mind-blowing. These are 2 songs combined, which have 11 minutes of continuous storytelling. Kendrick Lamar is more than capable of putting you on a journey through different periods and people in his life regardless if you were born and raised in a different part of the world, or had a much different family. </p>
